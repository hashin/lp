        <p>This page has appeared on the internet in many forms over the years. In a lot of ways, it reflected how I looked at the world at that point in time. Five years ago, I brought this domain impulsively - and have kept it alive ever since.</p> 
        <p>Like many things in my life, this page has assumed a life of its own. So I have decided to keep it as it is now. It might change again, at some point in time. But till then, you'll have it just like this.</p>
        <p>It is an ode to what I have been. It is an ode to what I am right now. It doesn't change a lot of things about me, but I believe that it might help me appreciate who I am - a bit better as I write about things I have learnt and care about.</p>
