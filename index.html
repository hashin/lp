        <p>Of course I love to write and you can find my blog <a href="https://blog.hashin.me" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        <p>But this page is not about what I write there. Things are a bit different here. For you to understand, you will have to read the following essays one by one.</p>
        <p>Point - you might be a bit early here and there aren't a lot of essays. But that's okay. You are invited to come back and read them when they are finally written down. I can assure you that they are around here, only waiting to be written down.</p>
        <p><a href="mailto:mail@hashin.me?subject=From%20Have%20You%20Met%20Hashin?" target="_blank"> I don't know who you are, but you are adviced to email me.</a></p>

        <p>This page has appeared on the internet in many forms over the years. In a lot of ways, it reflected how I looked at the world at that point in time. I brought this domain at a moment's passion - it felt like a cool thing to do. I thought that it was a passing fancy - I might forget to renew it and it would just go away like that. But it didn't. </p> 
        <p>Like many things in my life, it has assumed a life of its own. So I have decided to keep it as it is now. It might change again, at some point in time. But till then, it will live like this here.</p>
        <p>It is an ode to what I have been. It is an ode to what I am right now. It doesn't change a lot of things about me, but I believe that it might help me appreciate who I am - a bit better as I write about things I have learnt and care about.</p>
